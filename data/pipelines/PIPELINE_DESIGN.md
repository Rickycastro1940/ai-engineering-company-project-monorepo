# Business Performance Data Pipeline Design

**Company:** Brasaland (14 company-owned restaurants, Colombia and Florida)
**Department needs served:** Technology (Nicolás Park — pipeline into operations and finance dashboards), Restaurant Operations (Felipe Guerrero — purchase, waste, and stockouts per location), Procurement (Lucía Fernández — purchase cost and price-alert frequency), Executive Direction (Mariana Restrepo — Monday weekly numbers she can read without calling a location)
**Audience:** Mariana Restrepo (CEO) and Felipe Guerrero (Operations Director). Lucía Fernández reads the same location-week rows for purchase cost and price alerts.
**Deliverable:** Weekly Location Cost & Waste Report
**Cadence:** Once per chain week, Monday 07:00 America/Bogota, covering the previous chain week
**Aggregation:** One row per `location_id` per chain week. Costs stay in the location currency (COP in Colombia, USD in Florida). Do not average weekly ratios into a monthly rate in this table.
**Destination table:** `reporting.weekly_location_performance`
**Source (read-only):** `telemetry_events`, plus the `locations` dimension

## Destination tables

New analytical tables for this pipeline live in the `reporting` schema. They are not written into `telemetry_events`.

| Schema | Table | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reporting` | `weekly_location_performance` | The destination table. Full name: `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. One row per location per chain week, with purchase cost, waste cost, waste ratio, stockout frequency, and price-alert frequency. |
| `reporting` | `pipeline_runs` | Run log for that load (`reporting.pipeline_runs`). Not the KPI destination. |

`reporting.weekly_location_performance` is the name in the destination table contract. It is not `reporting.business_metrics`. It is not `reporting.weekly_location_metrics`. `GET /telemetry/report` does not read or write either table.

## Endpoints in `services/reporting/`

These three routes live in `services/reporting/`. That module is not `services/telemetry/`. None of the routes is `GET /telemetry/report`. None of them returns rows from `telemetry_events`.

| Role | Endpoint | Table it exposes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status | `GET /reporting/pipeline-runs/latest` | `reporting.pipeline_runs` |
| Manual trigger | `POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` | Starts the load into `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. Returns `202` and a `task_id`. |
| KPI query | `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance` | `reporting.weekly_location_performance` |

`services/reporting/` imports the orchestrator in `data/pipelines/`. `data/pipelines/` does not import `services/reporting/`. The engineering reader stays on `GET /telemetry/report` over `telemetry_events`.

## Brasaland domain vocabulary

Field names and values below match the monorepo. They are not generic retail placeholders.

### Locations (`services/api/locations.py`)

`location_id` on every operational event and every `reporting.weekly_location_performance` row is one of these 14 `Location.id` values. `country` is the `Location.country` enum. `currency` is the `Location.currency` enum. Florida is `region` on the API; the pipeline stores `country`, not `region`.

| `location_id` | Name | `country` | `currency` | `region` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `co-med-centro` | Medellín Centro | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-med-elpoblado` | Medellín El Poblado | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-bog-chapinero` | Bogotá Chapinero | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-bog-norte` | Bogotá Norte | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-cali-norte` | Cali Norte | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-barranquilla` | Barranquilla | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-cartagena` | Cartagena | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `co-pereira` | Pereira | Colombia | COP | Colombia |
| `us-mia-brickell` | Miami Brickell | United States | USD | Florida |
| `us-mia-downtown` | Miami Downtown | United States | USD | Florida |
| `us-orlando` | Orlando | United States | USD | Florida |
| `us-tampa` | Tampa | United States | USD | Florida |
| `us-ftlauderdale` | Fort Lauderdale | United States | USD | Florida |
| `us-jacksonville` | Jacksonville | United States | USD | Florida |

Eight Colombia ids, six Florida ids. Emitters must not use fixture labels such as `miami-downtown` or `medellin-centro`. A failed join that fills `currency` with `USD` would mislabel a COP kitchen.

### Inventory entities

Names below are the fields in this checkout. The live inventory file is `products.csv` (`product_id`, `name`, `quantity`, `unit`), read by `GET /inventory` in `services/api/inventory.py`. The declared order models are `Product`, `InboundOrder`, and `OutboundOrder` in `services/api/models.py`. `OrderType` in `services/api/schemas.py` is `INBOUND` or `OUTBOUND`.

| Entity | Fields in the monorepo | How this pipeline uses them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Product` (live row) | `product_id` integer ≥ 1, `name`, `quantity`, `unit`. Current rows: `1` Tomatoes `kg`, `2` Mozzarella `kg`, `3` Napkins `boxes` | `event_payload.product_id` is that integer. The weekly rollup does not group by `product_id`. It does not use `sku`. |
| `Product` (declared SQLModel) | `id`, `name`, `sku`, `unit` | Not the live writer. Do not switch the event id to `sku`. |
| `InboundOrder` | `id`, `product_id` (FK to `product.id`), `quantity`, `created_at`, `user_uuid`. `OrderType` `INBOUND` | One `inbound_order_created` per line. `event_payload.cost` feeds `total_purchase_cost`. `user_uuid` stays off the reporting row. |
| `OutboundOrder` | `id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `created_at`, `user_uuid`. `OrderType` `OUTBOUND` | Emits `outbound_order_created`. Out of `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. |
| `Location` | `id`, `name`, `city`, `country` (`Colombia` \| `United States`), `currency` (`COP` \| `USD`), `region` (`Colombia` \| `Florida`) | Join `locations.id` = `event_payload.location_id`. The reporting row stores `country` and `currency`. It does not store `region` or `city`. |
| Supplier | `CONTEXT.md`: about 20 suppliers (meat, vegetables, sauces, beverages, packaging, cleaning products). No `supplier_id` column in this checkout | `ingredient_price_variance_detected` is counted per `location_id`. This table does not mint a supplier key. |

`stock_waste_registered.reason` uses the three categories in `docs/company-knowledge-base/brasaland-waste-protocol.en.md`: `expiration`, `kitchen error`, and `unexplained shrinkage`. Amounts stay in `Location.currency`. The telemetry layer does not convert COP to USD.

### People and departments (`CONTEXT.md`)

| Name | Role | Why this pipeline exists for them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mariana Restrepo | CEO, Executive Direction | Monday 07:00 America/Bogota rollup instead of Tuesday PDFs |
| Felipe Guerrero | Restaurant Operations | Purchase, waste, stockouts per location |
| Lucía Fernández | Procurement | Purchase cost and price-alert frequency across markets |
| Nicolás Park | Technology | Engineering telemetry stays on `GET /telemetry/report`; this reporting module is separate |

This pipeline does not insert, update, or aggregate into `telemetry_events`. `telemetry_events` is the raw event log. Every new analytical table for this report lives in the `reporting` schema. The table name is `weekly_location_performance`. It is not `reporting.business_metrics` and it is not `reporting.weekly_location_metrics`.

HTTP that reads or triggers this report lives in `services/reporting/`. That module is separate from the engineering telemetry reader and from `GET /telemetry/report`. `services/reporting/` imports the orchestrator in `data/pipelines/`. `data/pipelines/` does not import `services/reporting/`.

## Where the work sits

| Path | Role in this pipeline |
| --- | --- |
| `data/raw/` | Optional landing copies of extracted events (for example a nightly CSV). Not the aggregation input and not the dashboard table. |
| `data/process/` | Reusable, side-effect-free transforms. `aggregate_location_kpis` belongs here so a test can call it without Prefect or HTTP. |
| `data/pipelines/` | Orchestration only: Prefect flow, extract, and load. Imports the transform from `data/process/`. |
| `data/eval/` | Hand-calculated location-week fixtures for roster ids (e.g. `us-mia-downtown`: purchase 1000 USD, waste 150 USD, ratio 0.15, one stockout, one price alert). |
| `services/reporting/` | `GET` the destination table and `POST` a run. No KPI arithmetic in the route. |

## Chain week

A chain week is `[Monday 00:00, next Monday 00:00)` in `America/Bogota`. The Monday 07:00 job reports the week that just closed.

Example: the job at Monday 2026-09-28 07:00 America/Bogota writes `week_start = 2026-09-21` and reads `created_at` in `[2026-09-21T05:00:00Z, 2026-09-28T05:00:00Z)`. The extract is inclusive of the start instant and exclusive of the end instant (`gte` / `lt`).

## KPIs this pipeline must produce

These five numbers are the weekly location grain of the telemetry floor. The engineering report (`events_per_day`, `error_rate_by_type`, `auth_failure_rate`) is a different reader and stays on `GET /telemetry/report`.

| KPI | Column on `reporting.weekly_location_performance` | Formula | Source `event_type` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase cost | `total_purchase_cost` | Sum of `event_payload.cost` | `inbound_order_created` |
| Waste cost | `total_waste_cost` | Sum of `event_payload.cost` | `stock_waste_registered` |
| Waste ratio | `waste_ratio` | `total_waste_cost / total_purchase_cost` when purchase cost > 0, else `0`. Round to 4 decimal places | the two cost events above |
| Stockout frequency | `stockout_events_count` | Count of rows | `stock_threshold_triggered` |
| Price alert frequency | `price_alert_events_count` | Count of rows | `ingredient_price_variance_detected` |

`event_payload.cost` is a number in `Location.currency` (`COP` or `USD`). Purchase and waste events always carry `cost`. Stockout and price-alert events omit `cost`; the transform treats a missing or non-numeric cost as `0` and only counts the row. A non-dict `event_payload` does not raise. It contributes cost `0` and no `location_id`, so the location group-by leaves it out of the rollup. `location_id` must be a `Location.id` from `services/api/locations.py`, not a fixture label such as `miami-downtown`.

The extract filters exactly those four `event_type` values. Other telemetry (`sale_completed`, `page_view`, `user_login_succeeded`, `user_login_failed`, `api_error`, chain-scoped inventory deltas) is out of this table.

Each output row also carries:

| Column | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `location_id` | `event_payload.location_id` — must equal a `Location.id` from the roster (e.g. `co-med-centro`, `us-mia-downtown`) |
| `week_start` | Chain-week start date passed into the run (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `country` | Left join to `locations.id`. Values are `Colombia` or `United States`. Unmatched location → `Unknown` |
| `currency` | Left join to `locations`. Values are `COP` or `USD`. Unmatched location → `USD` only as a documented fallback; emitters must send a roster id so a Colombia location is not labeled USD |

Primary key: `(location_id, week_start)`.

Colombia locations (`co-*`) stay in COP. United States / Florida locations (`us-*`) stay in USD. A chain total is two native sums. This table does not store a converted USD rollup.

## Phase 1 — Current State

### Current State

Brasaland Digital already has an engineering telemetry path. It is a platform-health report for Nicolás Park’s team. It is not the Monday purchasing report Mariana Restrepo, Felipe Guerrero, and Lucía Fernández need.

#### What we already have

| Piece | Where it lives | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Metric functions | `skills/data-analysis/scripts/pandas_clean.py` | `get_events_per_day`, `get_error_rate_by_type`, `get_auth_failure_rate` |
| Report endpoint | `skills/data-analysis/scripts/services/telemetry/main.py` | `GET /telemetry/report` reads `telemetry_events` and returns those three metrics |
| Engineering dashboard | `uis/backoffice/legacy/telemetry.html` | Three tables: traffic volume, system errors by type, authentication failure rate. It calls `GET /telemetry/report` |
| Cache | In-memory map on the report process | 60 seconds per `(start_date, end_date)`. If the query omits dates, the window is the last 7 days UTC |

The reader selects only `id`, `timestamp`, `event_type`, and `tags`. The JSON body is `{ period: { from, to }, metrics }`. It has no `location_id`, no `currency`, and no `cost`.

#### Telemetry events captured so far

Engineering events the technical report is written against:

| `event_type` | What it records | Which engineering metric uses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `user_login_succeeded` | A staff sign-in that succeeded | Daily volume, and the denominator of the auth failure rate |
| `user_login_failed` | A staff sign-in that failed | Daily volume, error counts, and the numerator of the auth failure rate |
| `api_error` | A technical API failure | Daily volume and error counts by type |

`get_events_per_day` counts every row in the window, so any other stored type still adds to daily traffic. The named error and auth metrics only branch on the three types above.

Operational events already defined for kitchens and suppliers. `GET /telemetry/report` does not aggregate them. They are the mandatory inputs for the five location-week KPIs:

| `event_type` | Fires when | KPI it feeds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inbound_order_created` | An `InboundOrder` line (`OrderType` `INBOUND`) is committed at a location | Purchase cost (`event_payload.cost`) |
| `stock_waste_registered` | Waste is logged. `reason` is `expiration`, `kitchen error`, or `unexplained shrinkage` (waste protocol) | Waste cost (`event_payload.cost`) |
| `stock_threshold_triggered` | Stock for a `Product` falls below the configured minimum at a location | Stockout frequency (row count) |
| `ingredient_price_variance_detected` | An inbound unit cost for a `Product` / supplier jumps versus history | Price-alert frequency (row count) |
| `outbound_order_created` | An `OutboundOrder` line (`OrderType` `OUTBOUND`) is committed | None. Out of this weekly table |
| `direct_stock_edit_rejected` | A direct stock edit is blocked (stock changes only via inbound/outbound orders) | None. Out of this weekly table |

Purchase, waste, stockout, and price-alert events carry `location_id` (a `Location.id` such as `co-med-centro` or `us-mia-downtown`), `country` (`Colombia` or `United States`), `product_id` (the integer from `products.csv`, for example `1` for Tomatoes), `quantity`, `unit` (`kg` or `boxes` on the current file), and `currency` (`COP` or `USD`). Waste also carries `reason`. Amounts stay in `Location.currency`. The telemetry layer does not convert COP to USD. `InboundOrder.user_uuid` is not a reporting column.

#### Where they are stored

Every captured event, engineering or operational, is one row in the Supabase table `telemetry_events`. The engineering reader filters that table with `timestamp >= start` and `timestamp < end`. `GET /telemetry/report` reads `telemetry_events` and returns the three engineering metrics. It does not write a second table. It does not write `reporting.weekly_location_performance`.

A nightly export (`scripts/nightly_export.py`) can copy a subset of those rows (`inbound_order_created`, `stock_waste_registered`, `stock_threshold_triggered`) into a CSV under the raw landing area. That CSV is a copy of events. It is not the dashboard table and it is not an aggregation.

#### What the technical report already answers for engineering

`GET /telemetry/report` answers three engineering questions, and only these:

1. **Traffic.** How many events hit the platform each UTC day? Formula: count of `id`, grouped by date (`events_per_day`).
2. **Failures.** Which technical failures showed up in the window? Formula: count of `api_error` and `user_login_failed`, grouped by `event_type` (`error_rate_by_type`).
3. **Sign-in health.** What share of login attempts failed each day? Formula: `user_login_failed / (user_login_failed + user_login_succeeded)`, rounded to 4 decimal places (`auth_failure_rate`).

`uis/backoffice/legacy/telemetry.html` renders those three tables. That is enough for Nicolás Park to see load, instability, and authentication trouble. It says nothing about a kitchen’s purchases, waste, stockouts, or supplier price moves.

### Business Gap

`CONTEXT.md` still has a purchasing question the technical report cannot answer.

Restaurant Operations (`CONTEXT.md`): “Ingredient orders are placed by WhatsApp or phone, resulting in overstock in some locations and stockouts in others.” Felipe Guerrero has no per-location view of what a kitchen bought or threw away.

Procurement (`CONTEXT.md`): “Lucía finds out about raw material price changes when the invoice arrives. There is no consolidated purchasing data across the chain.” She needs price alerts and purchasing visibility across Colombia and Florida.

Executive Direction (`CONTEXT.md`): weekly PDFs arrive on Tuesday. Mariana Restrepo needs a report every Monday at 7am. The engineering dashboard is not that report.

The unanswered question this pipeline exists to answer:

**For each of the 14 locations, in the chain week that just closed, what was the purchase cost, the waste cost, the waste ratio, the stockout frequency, and the price-alert frequency, in that location’s own currency (COP or USD)?**

`GET /telemetry/report` cannot answer it. Its select list never reads `cost` or `location_id`, and its three metrics never group `inbound_order_created`, `stock_waste_registered`, `stock_threshold_triggered`, or `ingredient_price_variance_detected`. Counting those rows inside `events_per_day` only increases a platform traffic total. It does not produce a location-week cost.

That question needs a dedicated pipeline: read those four event types for one chain week, join `locations` for country and currency, aggregate one row per location, and load `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. The engineering endpoint stays the engineering endpoint. Sales questions in `CONTEXT.md` (covers today at Medellín Centro, a slow week at the Miami restaurant, Florida week sales, highest average ticket) are a different grain and are not this table.

## Phase 2 — Pipeline design

### Purpose

This pipeline produces the Weekly Location Cost & Waste roll-up in `reporting.weekly_location_performance` that feeds Mariana Restrepo’s executive report, read with Felipe Guerrero and Lucía Fernández, every Monday at 07:00 America/Bogota.

### Business deliverable

The deliverable is that Monday roll-up: one row per Brasaland location for the chain week that just closed (`[Monday 00:00, next Monday 00:00)` in `America/Bogota`). Costs stay in the location currency (COP in Colombia, USD in Florida). The row is what the Monday 07:00 report reads. It is not a row in `telemetry_events`, and it is not a metric on `GET /telemetry/report`.

### KPIs it computes

These are the five numbers in the KPIs this pipeline must produce. Each is one column on `reporting.weekly_location_performance`.

| KPI | Column | Formula | Source `event_type` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purchase cost | `total_purchase_cost` | Sum of `event_payload.cost` | `inbound_order_created` |
| Waste cost | `total_waste_cost` | Sum of `event_payload.cost` | `stock_waste_registered` |
| Waste ratio | `waste_ratio` | `total_waste_cost / total_purchase_cost` when purchase cost > 0, else `0`, rounded to 4 decimal places | the two cost events |
| Stockout frequency | `stockout_events_count` | Count of rows | `stock_threshold_triggered` |
| Price alert frequency | `price_alert_events_count` | Count of rows | `ingredient_price_variance_detected` |

### Extraction format

The source is `telemetry_events`, plus the existing `locations` domain table. Both are read from Supabase as a JSON array of row objects (PostgREST). The pipeline keeps that JSON only for the run. It writes the roll-up to `reporting.weekly_location_performance`.

| Source | Why it is read | Format the data arrives in | How often it is updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `telemetry_events` | Facts for the five KPIs | One JSON object per event. Columns used: `id` (UUID), `event_type`, `created_at`, `event_payload` (JSON). `event_payload.location_id` is a roster id such as `co-bog-norte` or `us-orlando`. Cost events also carry `event_payload.cost` as a number in that location’s `COP` or `USD` | Continuously, as each kitchen acts. A new receipt, waste log, stockout, or price jump is an insert. A correction of a receipt **updates the existing row** (same `id`, new `cost`). It does not insert a second event. |
| `locations` | Country and currency for the 14 sites | One JSON object per site, the same shape as `GET /locations`: `id`, `country` (`Colombia` or `United States`), `currency` (`COP` or `USD`) | When a location record is edited. The same `id` is updated in place. The table is 14 rows. |

The extract for `telemetry_events` is one chain-week snapshot: `event_type` in `inbound_order_created`, `stock_waste_registered`, `stock_threshold_triggered`, `ingredient_price_variance_detected`, and `created_at >= window_start` and `created_at < window_end`. `locations` is read in full. Both snapshots are taken when the job runs: Monday 07:00 America/Bogota for the previous chain week, or when `POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` asks for a window. The pipeline does not tail the tables between those runs.

### Data flow

Extraction, transformation, and load are three separate stages. Extraction only reads. Transformation only computes a frame. Load only writes that frame.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph extraction [1 Extraction]
    A[(telemetry_events JSON rows)]
    B[(locations JSON rows)]
  end
  subgraph transformation [2 Transformation]
    C[Dedupe on event id then one row per location and week]
  end
  subgraph load [3 Load]
    D[(reporting.weekly_location_performance)]
  end
  A --> C
  B --> C
  C --> D
```

1. **Extraction.** `extract_telemetry_events` and `extract_domain_data` in `data/pipelines/pipeline.py` pull the two JSON snapshots for the requested window. They do not sum costs.
2. **Transformation.** `aggregate_location_kpis` in `data/process/` drops duplicate event `id`s, reads `location_id` and `cost` from `event_payload`, sums and counts by location, joins `locations`, and emits one row per `location_id` with `week_start` set to the chain-week start. It does not write to Supabase.
3. **Load.** `upsert_to_reporting_table` writes those rows to `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. It does not re-read `telemetry_events`.

`GET /telemetry/report` stays on its own reader. It is not one of these three stages.

### Source rows that are updated, and how duplicates are avoided

`telemetry_events` does not only insert. A corrected `InboundOrder` keeps `telemetry_events.id` and changes `event_payload.cost` on that same row. `locations.id` is the same kind of key: an edit changes `country` or `currency` on the existing `Location` row.

An append-only strategy would treat the corrected receipt as new money and add it to the cost already stored for the week. This pipeline does not do that. Every run is a fresh snapshot of the current rows for the whole chain week. It does not keep a high-water mark of inserts since the last run, and it does not add this run’s costs onto the costs already stored for that week.

Concrete case. Chain week `week_start = 2026-09-21`. `Location.id` `us-mia-downtown` (Miami Downtown, `country` `United States`, `currency` `USD`, `region` `Florida`). `InboundOrder` for `product_id` `1` (Tomatoes, `unit` `kg`, `OrderType` `INBOUND`). `telemetry_events.id` `7c2e9a14-6b0d-4f3a-9e21-0b8d4c1a55f6`, `event_type` `inbound_order_created`, `event_payload.cost` `1000` USD. A correction updates that same `id` to `cost` `1200`. It does not insert a second event. `user_uuid` on the order is not written to the reporting row.

| Step | What happens to `7c2e9a14-6b0d-4f3a-9e21-0b8d4c1a55f6` | `total_purchase_cost` for `us-mia-downtown` / `2026-09-21` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extract | The week snapshot contains that `id` once, with `event_payload.cost` 1200 and `event_payload.location_id` `us-mia-downtown`. The old 1000 is gone because the row was updated. | — |
| If the JSON lists that `id` twice | Drop duplicates on `telemetry_events.id` before any sum, keeping one copy. | The 1200 is not added to itself. |
| Transform | Sum `event_payload.cost` on the remaining `inbound_order_created` rows. Join `locations.id` for `country` and `currency`. | `total_purchase_cost` = 1200 USD, not 1000 + 1200. `currency` is `USD`. |
| Load | `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (location_id, week_start) DO UPDATE` sets `total_purchase_cost = EXCLUDED.total_purchase_cost`. | The existing location-week row is replaced with 1200. A second Monday run does not insert another row and does not add 1200 to the stored total. |

The same three rules apply to waste cost, stockout count, and price-alert count: dedupe on `telemetry_events.id`, recompute the week from that snapshot, then replace the destination key `(location_id, week_start)`. The conflict clause assigns the new total. It is not `total_purchase_cost = weekly_location_performance.total_purchase_cost + EXCLUDED.total_purchase_cost`.

`locations` uses the same snapshot rule. The join reads the site row as it exists at extract time, and the upsert writes that `country` and `currency` onto the existing location-week key.

## Phase 3 — Resilience and idempotency

### Idempotency strategy

The grain of `reporting.weekly_location_performance` is one row per `(location_id, week_start)`. That pair is the primary key. Load sends the full recomputed week for each location, then replaces that key. It never adds a delta onto a row that is already stored.

If the load fails after some rows are written (dropped connection, statement timeout, process kill) and the job is rerun for the same chain week, already loaded rows are neither corrupted nor duplicated. The rerun uses the same `window_start` and `window_end` as the failed attempt. The Monday job and `POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` both pass that pair through.

The guarantee has three steps, in this order:

1. **Recompute the whole chain week before any write.** Transformation reads the current `telemetry_events` snapshot, dedupes on `id`, and builds a complete frame. Each output row already contains the final `total_purchase_cost`, `total_waste_cost`, `waste_ratio`, `stockout_events_count`, and `price_alert_events_count` for that location and week. The load never sends a partial sum or a delta.
2. **Replace the key, including rows loaded before the crash.** Load is one upsert: `INSERT INTO reporting.weekly_location_performance ... ON CONFLICT (location_id, week_start) DO UPDATE SET` every KPI column, `country`, and `currency` to the excluded values (`on_conflict=location_id,week_start`). A location-week that was written in the failed attempt is overwritten with those same totals. A location-week that never landed is inserted. The primary key blocks a second row for the same location and week.
3. **The update assigns the new total. It does not add.** The conflict clause is `total_purchase_cost = EXCLUDED.total_purchase_cost` (and the same assignment for waste cost, waste ratio, stockout count, and price-alert count). It is not `total_purchase_cost = weekly_location_performance.total_purchase_cost + EXCLUDED.total_purchase_cost`.

Concrete case. The Monday job for `week_start = 2026-09-21` builds 14 location rows. Load writes `co-med-centro` with `total_purchase_cost = 18500000` COP, then the connection drops before `us-mia-downtown` is written. `co-med-centro` already holds the full week, not a partial sum. `us-mia-downtown` still holds the previous week, or it is absent.

The rerun recomputes the same 14 totals from the same window. The upsert sets `co-med-centro` / `2026-09-21` to `18500000` again. It does not store `37000000`, and it does not insert a second row for Medellín Centro. It inserts `us-mia-downtown` / `2026-09-21` once. After the rerun there is still one row per location for that week, with the same figures a single successful load would have written.

### Execution log

Every attempt appends one row to `reporting.pipeline_runs` and mirrors the latest row in `data/pipelines/last_run.json` for `GET /reporting/pipeline-runs/latest`. The row is inserted with `status = Running` and the start time when the flow begins. It is updated when the flow finishes or when load raises. A failed load and the rerun that follows are two rows, so production can see both.

Minimum fields on every run:

| Audit name | Column | Data type | What is recorded | Why this field is necessary in production |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Start time | `started_at` | `timestamptz` (UTC) | Instant this attempt began | Shows whether the Monday 07:00 America/Bogota job actually started, and the gap after the previous success. No start time means the scheduler never fired. You cannot audit a missing week without it. |
| End time | `finished_at` | `timestamptz` (UTC), nullable | Instant this attempt ended, success or failure | With the start time, gives duration. A start time with a null end time means the attempt is still in load or died without closing the log. That is the row to rerun. A finished failure still has an end time, so it is not confused with a run that is in progress. |
| Records processed | `records_processed` | `integer` | Count of `telemetry_events` rows in the deduped extract for the window | Tells an auditor whether the week had events. A sudden zero against a normally busy week means the extract missed the window or the source was empty. A count that matches the prior success, with the same KPI totals, confirms the rerun replaced rows instead of stacking them. |
| Status | `status` | `text` (`Running` \| `Success` \| `Failed`) | Outcome of this attempt | Separates a finished week from a load that stopped halfway. `Failed` is the signal to rerun that window. `Success` means every location-week key from the frame was upserted. A location with zero waste can still be `Success`. |
| Errors | `error_message` | `text`, nullable | Public failure text when `status` is `Failed`; null on success | Names the load failure (timeout, connection drop) so the rerun is aimed at the broken stage. Without it, a `Failed` status does not say whether to retry the store or to fix the window. The text stays free of connection strings, keys, and host paths. |

`window_start` and `window_end` are stored on the same row so the rerun passes the identical chain week. `run_id` distinguishes the failed attempt from the retry in the audit list.

## Phase 4 — Mapping to Prefect

Part 1 is one main flow and three tasks. A second flow for backfill is optional here. Part 3 is where extract, transform, and load become their own subflows.

### Main flow

| Prefect concept | Brasaland object |
| --- | --- |
| Flow | `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline` (`run_pipeline(start_date, end_date)` in `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`) |
| Parameters | `start_date`, `end_date`: the chain-week bounds passed to extract and stored on the run log |
| Schedule | Deployment cron Monday 07:00 America/Bogota. The parameters are the previous chain week. |
| What it does | Calls extract, then transform, then load, in that order. Writes `reporting.pipeline_runs` around the call. |

### Tasks

| Task | Stage | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `extract_weekly_inputs` | Extract | Reads the JSON snapshots: `telemetry_events` for the four KPI event types in the window, and `locations` (`id`, `country`, `currency`). Returns both frames. Retries on a store timeout. |
| `aggregate_location_kpis` | Transform | Dedupes on event `id`, sums purchase and waste cost, counts stockouts and price alerts, joins `locations`, and returns one row per `location_id` for `week_start`. No database write. |
| `upsert_to_reporting_table` | Load | Upserts that frame into `reporting.weekly_location_performance` on `(location_id, week_start)`, assigning the recomputed totals. Retries on a store timeout. |

`extract_telemetry_events` and `extract_domain_data` are the two reads inside the extract task. They stay in this one task until Part 3 splits the stages into subflows.

### States

Prefect state on the flow is what operators see. The same outcome is copied to `reporting.pipeline_runs.status`.

| Prefect state | When it applies | Run log |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Running` | The flow has started and extract, transform, or load is still in progress | `Running`, `started_at` set, `finished_at` empty |
| `Completed` | Load upsert finished for every row in the frame | `Success`, `finished_at` set, `records_processed` set |
| `Failed` | Extract or load raised after its retries, or transform raised | `Failed`, `finished_at` set, `error_message` set. The rerun uses the same window and the Phase 3 upsert. |

`Scheduled` is only the deployment waiting for Monday 07:00. It is not a run-log status.

### Script-based execution (CLI)

Phase 4 ships a script entry so the same Prefect flow can run outside the deployment. From the monorepo root:

```bash
# Default window: previous chain week in America/Bogota (same bounds as the Monday job)
python data/pipelines/pipeline.py

# Explicit chain week (example matches data/eval fixtures)
python data/pipelines/pipeline.py --start-date 2026-09-21 --end-date 2026-09-28

# Force fixture-backed offline mode (also auto-selected when SUPABASE_* is unset)
python data/pipelines/pipeline.py --offline
```

`if __name__ == "__main__"` calls `main()`, which resolves the window, optionally installs offline backends (eval fixtures → local `data/raw/` upsert store), then runs `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline`.

### Intended reporting schedule

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cadence | Once per chain week |
| Cron / wall clock | Monday **07:00** `America/Bogota` |
| Window | Previous chain week: `[Monday 00:00, next Monday 00:00)` America/Bogota |
| Flow | `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline` |
| Entry | Deployment schedule **or** `python data/pipelines/pipeline.py` |

Example: the job that fires Monday 2026-09-28 at 07:00 America/Bogota reports `[2026-09-21, 2026-09-28)`. Mariana Restrepo and Felipe Guerrero read that roll-up instead of waiting for Tuesday PDF packs.

### Optional second flow

`brasaland_weekly_backfill_flow(weeks)` is optional in Part 1. It would call the same three tasks once per chain week (a missed Monday, or a receipt corrected after the report). It does not define new KPI rules. Part 1 ships the Monday flow only. Part 3 splits extract, transform, and load into subflows; the backfill flow would call those subflows per week.

### Prefect blocks

The Supabase connection is a Prefect block, not a value in `data/pipelines/`.

| Block | Type | What it holds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `brasaland-supabase` | Secret block, or a credentials block with a URL and a key | `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` for the project that stores `telemetry_events`, `locations`, and `reporting.weekly_location_performance` |

The flow loads `brasaland-supabase` at the start of extract and load. Local runs may read the same two names from `.env` when the block is absent. The URL and the key are never written into the repository or into this document.

## Phase 5 — Application integration

Design only. This phase does not add route code. `services/reporting/` is an HTTP shell. Each route below imports one function or flow from `data/pipelines/`. No ETL logic belongs in `services/`: no extract, no transform, no load, no sum of `cost`, no event-type filter, no join to `locations`, and no upsert. `data/pipelines/` does not import `services/reporting/`.

These routes are not in `services/telemetry/`. They are not `GET /telemetry/report`. They do not read or write `telemetry_events`. `GET /telemetry/report` does not read `reporting.weekly_location_performance`.

| Business role | Endpoint in `services/reporting/` | Calls in `data/pipelines/` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status query | `GET /reporting/pipeline-runs/latest` | `get_latest_pipeline_run()` |
| Manual trigger | `POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` | `run_pipeline(start_date, end_date)` — Prefect flow `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline` |
| KPI query | `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance` | `get_weekly_location_performance(week_start=None)` |

### Status query

`GET /reporting/pipeline-runs/latest` calls `get_latest_pipeline_run()` in `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`. That function returns the newest `reporting.pipeline_runs` row (mirrored in `data/pipelines/last_run.json`): `started_at`, `finished_at`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `records_processed`, `status`, `error_message`. The route validates nothing beyond the HTTP call and returns that JSON. It does not open `telemetry_events` and it does not start a run.

### Manual trigger

`POST /reporting/pipeline-runs` accepts `{ "start_date": "...", "end_date": "..." }` and calls `run_pipeline(start_date, end_date)` in `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`, the flow `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline`. The route returns `202` with `{ "task_id": "..." }`. The worker inside that flow runs extract, transform, and load. The route does not call `extract_telemetry_events`, `aggregate_location_kpis`, or `upsert_to_reporting_table` itself.

### KPI query

`GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance` calls `get_weekly_location_performance(week_start=None)` in `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`. That function selects from `reporting.weekly_location_performance` only. Optional query `week_start` filters one chain week. This is the feed Part 3’s dashboard will consume for Mariana Restrepo, Felipe Guerrero, and Lucía Fernández. Example body:

```json
{
  "week_start": "2026-09-21",
  "locations": [
    {
      "location_id": "co-med-centro",
      "country": "Colombia",
      "currency": "COP",
      "total_purchase_cost": 18500000,
      "total_waste_cost": 920000,
      "waste_ratio": 0.0497,
      "stockout_events_count": 2,
      "price_alert_events_count": 1
    },
    {
      "location_id": "us-mia-downtown",
      "country": "United States",
      "currency": "USD",
      "total_purchase_cost": 1000,
      "total_waste_cost": 150,
      "waste_ratio": 0.15,
      "stockout_events_count": 1,
      "price_alert_events_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

The route does not recompute waste ratio from events.

`GET /tasks/{task_id}` may sit beside the manual trigger so a client can poll until `run_pipeline` finishes. It is not one of the three business endpoints and it does not run ETL.
