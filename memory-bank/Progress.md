# Progress — Brasaland Digital

Verified **2026-09-16** on clone `Rickycastro1940/ai-engineering-company-project-monorepo`, branch `feature/auth-frontend`. Gaps below are scored against root [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) department needs.

## Agent infrastructure (aligned to `CONTEXT.md`)

- Root `CONTEXT.md` / `CONTEXT.es.md` replaced with official Brasaland briefings (`00-general-contexts/CONTEXT-brasaland-briefing.*.md`). Placeholder four-company list removed.
- `memory-bank/` (`Projectbrief.md`, `Techcontext.md`, this file) cites `CONTEXT.md` departments, currencies, and Technology/Executive needs.
- `AGENTS.md` + `.agents/rules/00-operating-loop.md` (**always active**) enforce Brasaland-only facts from `CONTEXT.md`.
- Skill `.agents/skills/verify-brasaland-api/` checks the running API against Technology’s central-API list in `CONTEXT.md` (locations, menus, sales, customers, suppliers) plus the inventory slice used for Operations stock.

## Coverage vs `CONTEXT.md` (this checkout)

| `CONTEXT.md` need | Status in monorepo |
| --- | --- |
| Technology: central API (locations, menus, sales, customers, suppliers) | **Present (seeded)** — `locations`/`menus`/`sales`/`customers`/`suppliers`/`inventory=present` plus `knowledge=present` (`POST /knowledge/query`) and `realtime=present` (`GET /realtime/ops-alerts/stream`) on `uvicorn api.app:app` (`:8000`). Not a live POS or invoice feed |
| Technology: telemetry + pipeline to dashboards | **Partial** — `POST /telemetry/events` validates each Phase 1 envelope and bulk-inserts valid rows into Supabase `public.telemetry_events`, returning `{received, stored, rejected}`. The backoffice capture client is unchanged. Live no-sales SSE, weekly location cost/waste ETL, Prefect subflows, and the Monday report stay. Engineering `GET /telemetry/report` is untouched. The Monday extractor still selects `event_payload`, which this collector table does not have |
| Operations: sales per location COP/USD; no-sales alerts; smart ordering | **Partial** — seeded `GET /sales` tickets and `/sales/overview` (COP and USD, 14 locations) plus `/sales/alerts`; `POST /sales` stores a ticket and calls `record_sale` so the live no-sales alert on backoffice `/accessible` sees that location; Next.js `uis/portal` `/ops/sales` shows per-location sales in COP and USD. Smart ordering still open |
| Procurement: supplier price history, consolidated spend | **Partial** — seeded `GET /suppliers` (20 suppliers, Colombia and Florida, price history and alerts); Monday weekly purchase cost / price-alert frequency still separate; invoices are not live |
| Marketing: digital Brasa Points, CRM, personalisation | **Partial** — `GET /customers` CRM seed with `brasa_points_balance` on physical stamp cards; Next.js `uis/portal` `/points` looks up a guest and shows Brasa Points balance, history, and tier rewards (fixtures, or `GET /customers` when `BRASALAND_DATA_SOURCE=live`); `uis/website/` corporate home (`/`) live. `CONTEXT.md` still describes stamp cards as today’s in-restaurant programme |
| People: HR portal / KPIs by country | **Not done** |
| Training: recipe catalogue, push to 14 locations | **Partial** — `POST /knowledge/query` searches the four English standards (allergens, waste, ordering, Brasa Points) and returns cited chunks. Not a full recipe catalogue and not a push to all 14 kitchens |
| Executive: sales USD+COP dashboard, NL assistant, Monday 07:00 report | **Partial** — seeded `GET /sales/overview` and portal `/ops/sales` chain totals in COP and USD; Monday weekly ops & finance report in the backoffice; n8n export `workflows/brasaland-monday-leadership-report.n8n.json` schedules Monday 07:00 America/Bogota, logs into the central API, pulls `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance`, and delivers COP/USD leadership copy (email, Slack, CSV) with a failure branch. Standards questions can go to `POST /knowledge/query`. A sales NL assistant and a chain sales dashboard remain open |

## What already runs (engineering)

| Area | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory API + Groq agent | `services/api/inventory.py` (CSV-backed flat imports; no package-relative `.auth`), `agent.py` |
| Incident analysis UI | `uis/web` |
| Weekly cost/waste pipeline + Celery | `data/process/location_kpis.py`, `data/pipelines/pipeline.py`, `services/reporting/main.py`, `services/tasks.py`; Compose Redis/Flower/worker |
| Public corporate website | `uis/website/` — Vite/React, route `/`, brand tokens + components from `CONTEXT.md`; screenshot `docs/screenshots/website-corporate-home.png` |
| Internal backoffice | `uis/backoffice/` — JWT session; `/accessible` locations+inventory; `/reporting/weekly-performance` Monday weekly ops & finance report (COP/USD) |
| Locations API | `services/api/locations.py` — 14 locations, Colombia 8 / Florida 6, COP+USD; **Bearer JWT required** |

## Latest auth-frontend evidence (`feature/auth-frontend`)

Department served: **Technology** (JSON auth API restored onto the central FastAPI app) + **Operations/Executive** (staff backoffice is now session-gated).

```text

```

JWT login/register for the staff console is **present**. Technology’s menus/sales/customers/suppliers nouns remain **missing**.

## Latest verify-brasaland-api evidence (`feature/agent-memory-bank`)

Department served: **Technology** (central API coverage) + **Marketing** (corporate site) + **Operations/Executive** (backoffice location footprint).

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
GET http://127.0.0.1:8001/docs → 200
locations=present
menus=missing
sales=missing
customers=missing
suppliers=missing
inventory=present
path_count=14
GET /locations/overview → 14 locations (company Brasaland)
GET /inventory → 200
```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 + 6). Technology central API is **not complete** while menus/sales/customers/suppliers remain `missing`.

## Latest error-handling audit (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (central API must fail safely) + **Operations/Executive** (staff see errors, not a blank console).

```text
pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_users_api.py -q → 19 passed
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → green
cd uis/website && npm run build → green
Checklist: docs/error-handling-audit.md
```

## Latest three-state fetch UI (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Operations/Executive** (staff console must not go blank while locations/inventory load) + **Technology** (session and API failures need a retry path).

```text
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → tsc -b && vite build green
Browser :5174/login invalid credentials → alert + Sign in retry CTA; button showed Signing in…
Register Creating account… then /accessible with 14 locations (COP+USD roster)
/account/profile → email async-ui-0918@brasaland.test + Save profile form
uis/website has no fetch (static corporate home)
```

## Latest user-facing error copy (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Operations/Executive** (staff see plain-language failures with retry/home/support) + **Technology** (API errors are mapped, not dumped).

```text
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → tsc -b && vite build green
```

## Latest FastAPI exception scope (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (central API handlers catch I/O at the call site; programming errors still hit the generic 500 handler).

```text
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_users_api.py -q → 24 passed
```

## Latest structured HTTP errors (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (central API returns 400/404/422/500 as JSON, never Python tracebacks).

```text
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_users_api.py -q → 24 passed
Envelope: status, code, message, detail (422 detail remains field loc/msg/type)
GET /inventory RuntimeError → 500 {"code":"internal_error","message":"Internal server error"} no traceback
```

## Latest secret-safe errors + external calls (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (client JSON must not leak connection strings, keys, or host paths; LLM/Qdrant/Supabase calls must fail closed).

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs → 200
locations=present
menus=missing
sales=missing
customers=missing
suppliers=missing
inventory=present
path_count=21
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_users_api.py -q → 27 passed
error_body(500, postgres://… / sk- / /Users/) → generic Internal server error
ExternalServiceError("language model") on GET /inventory → 503 language model is unavailable
```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 + 6). Technology central API remains **incomplete** while menus/sales/customers/suppliers are `missing`.

## Latest script file/CSV error handling (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (CLI tools must fail closed) + **Operations** (incident CSV analysis for kitchens/locations).

```text
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_scripts_io.py tests/test_error_handling.py -q → 16 passed
uv run python scripts/analyze.py scripts/does-not-exist.csv → STDERR + exit 1
```

## Latest log redaction (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (no stack traces or host paths in operator consoles) + **Marketing** (public site ErrorBoundary).

```text
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_scripts_io.py -q → 16 passed
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → green
cd uis/website && npm run build → green
ErrorBoundary console.error no longer includes error or componentStack
```

## Latest finally / client-safe / script I/O closeout (`feature/error-handling-audit`)

Department served: **Technology** (structured HTTP, no env names in 503s) + **Operations/Executive** (loading flags always clear; login session failure has retry).

```text
uv run python -m pytest tests/test_error_handling.py tests/test_scripts_io.py tests/test_users_api.py -q → 33 passed
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → green
```

## Latest business performance pipeline Part 2 (`cursor/business-performance-pipeline-part2-4f14`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás — pipeline into ops/finance dashboards) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe — purchase/waste/stockouts) + **Procurement** (Lucía — purchase cost + price alerts) + **Executive** (Mariana — Monday location-week numbers).

Implemented against `CONTEXT-company.md` (KPIs to Measure / destination schema / endpoints) and approved `data/pipelines/PIPELINE_DESIGN.md`:

- Pure transform in `data/process/location_kpis.py` (dedupe on `telemetry_events.id`, five KPIs, roster `location_id`s).
- Prefect **3** flow `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline` with stage subflows
  `extract_brasaland_data_flow` → `transform_brasaland_kpis_flow` → `load_brasaland_reporting_flow`
  and tasks `extract_telemetry_events` / `extract_domain_data` / `aggregate_location_kpis` /
  `upsert_to_reporting_table` into `reporting.weekly_location_performance`.
- Extract lands in `data/raw/`; validation output in `data/eval/last_validation.json`.
- Destination `reporting.weekly_location_performance` + run log `reporting.pipeline_runs` (SQL in `data/pipelines/reporting_schema.sql`); mirror `data/pipelines/last_run.json`.
- HTTP shell in `services/reporting/` only — engineering telemetry left alone.

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
uv run python -c "import prefect; print(prefect.__version__)" → 3.4.25
uv run python -m pytest tests/pipelines/ -q → 23 passed
Idempotent load: upsert on_conflict=location_id,week_start (CONTEXT PK); identical re-run payloads
Run metadata: started_at, finished_at, records_processed, status, error_message → pipeline_runs + last_run.json + pipeline_run_log.jsonl
```

## Latest Phase one — Prefect subflows (`cursor/pipeline-phase1-subflows-4f14`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás — pipeline structure) + **Operations/Executive** (weekly KPI stages stay readable and isolatable).

Hardened `data/pipelines/pipeline.py` so Monday ETL is three stage `@flow` subflows with explicit I/O (no shared globals), plus optional eval as its own subflow:

| Subflow `name=` | Inputs → Outputs |
| --- | --- |
| `extract_brasaland_data_flow` | `(start_date, end_date)` → `(telemetry_df, locations_df)` |
| `transform_brasaland_kpis_flow` | `(telemetry_df, locations_df, week_start)` → `kpis_df` |
| `load_brasaland_reporting_flow` | `kpis_df` → rows upserted |
| `eval_brasaland_snapshot_flow` | `(kpis_df, week_start)` → validation dict (`return_state=True` from main) |

Main flow remains `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline`. Destination stays `reporting.weekly_location_performance`. `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` Phase 4 name contract updated.

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/test_prefect_stages.py tests/pipelines/test_name_contract.py -q → 14 passed
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/ -q → 30 passed
```

## Latest Phase two — transform unit tests (`cursor/pipeline-phase2-transform-tests-4f14`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás — KPI transform correctness) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe — purchase/waste/stockouts) + **Procurement** (Lucía — purchase cost + price alerts).

Extended `tests/pipelines/test_pipeline.py` with isolated in-memory unit tests for CONTEXT-company.md "KPIs to Measure" (no DB / external APIs): `total_purchase_cost`, `total_waste_cost`, `waste_ratio` (hand-calculated 4dp + zero-purchase → 0), `stockout_events_count` / `price_alert_events_count`, Prefect task `.fn` parity, and defensive malformed payloads (non-dict, null cost/location, wrong cost type, missing columns).

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/test_pipeline.py -v → 14 passed
```

## Latest Phase three — CLI after subflow refactor (`cursor/pipeline-phase3-cli-4f14`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás — Monday-runnable pipeline into ops/finance) + **Executive** (Mariana — Monday 07:00 America/Bogota reporting cycle).

After Phase one subflow hardening, restored Part 2 / Phase 4 script entry onto the same Prefect flow (did not invent a new CLI module):

- `if __name__ == "__main__"` → `main()` → `brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline` / `run_pipeline`
- Flags: `--start-date`, `--end-date`, `--offline` (also auto-offline when `SUPABASE_*` unset)
- Offline rebinds `fetch_telemetry_events` / `fetch_domain_locations` / `persist_kpi_records` so extract → transform → load subflows still run with explicit I/O
- `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` Script-based execution / Intended reporting schedule docs kept (same commands)

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
.venv/bin/python data/pipelines/pipeline.py --offline --start-date 2026-09-21 --end-date 2026-09-28
→ exit 0; status=Success records_processed=9
  subflows: extract_brasaland_data_flow → transform_brasaland_kpis_flow → load_brasaland_reporting_flow (Completed)
.venv/bin/python data/pipelines/pipeline.py --offline
→ exit 0; status=Success records_processed=9; window=[2026-09-14, 2026-09-21)
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/ -q → 36 passed
```

## Planned next steps (order)

1. Keep every product change traceable to a `CONTEXT.md` department need (name the section in the PR/commit).
2. Central API nouns **locations, menus, sales, customers, and suppliers** are seeded on `uvicorn api.app:app`. A live POS, live invoices, and a digital Brasa Points wallet are still open.
3. Executive path: chain sales in **USD and COP** are seeded and shown on portal `/ops/sales`. Monday 07:00 delivery is the n8n workflow in `workflows/` (it reads the reporting API; it does not enqueue the pipeline). Keep Mariana’s NL assistant on the documented agent loop.
4. Later phases: keep staff dashboard consumers for `reporting.weekly_location_performance` current; extend sales USD+COP for Mariana.
5. Do not rewrite the monorepo or invent another company.

## Latest Phase four — business dashboard (`cursor/pipeline-phase4-dashboard-4f14`)

Department served: **Executive** (Mariana — Monday location-week numbers) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe — purchase/waste/stockouts) + **Procurement** (Lucía — purchase cost + price alerts) + **Technology** (Nicolás — reporting feed on central API).

Backoffice page `/reporting/weekly-performance` fetches Bearer-gated `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance` and renders every CONTEXT-company.md KPI (Purchase cost, Waste cost, Waste ratio, Stockout frequency, Price alert frequency) with chain-week period (`week_start` + `[Monday, next Monday)` America/Bogota) and COP/USD rows. Vite proxies API paths only (`/reporting/weekly-location-performance`, `/reporting/pipeline-runs`) so the SPA route is not swallowed. Reporting routes mounted on `services/api/app.py` with JWT; offline KPI store readable when Supabase unset.

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs → 200
locations=present menus=missing sales=missing customers=missing suppliers=missing inventory=present reporting=present
path_count=25
GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance without token → 401
GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance with Bearer → 200, week_start=2026-09-21, COP+USD rows, five KPI columns
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → tsc -b && vite build green
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/ -q → 41 passed
```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 + 6). Technology central API remains **incomplete** while menus/sales/customers/suppliers are `missing`.

## Latest Phase four stakeholder UX (`cursor/pipeline-phase4-stakeholder-ux-4f14`)

Department served: **Executive** (Mariana) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe) + **Procurement** (Lucía) — Monday report must be legible without API/table jargon.

Hardened `uis/backoffice` Monday weekly report copy for leadership:

- Title/nav: “Monday weekly ops & finance report” / “Monday weekly report” (not “Weekly KPIs” / KPI query)
- Lead and empty states drop endpoint paths, table names, Bearer, backticks, CLI commands, and engineering telemetry notes
- Column labels stay CONTEXT-company.md exact: Purchase cost, Waste cost, Waste ratio, Stockout frequency, Price alert frequency
- Period shown as chain week starting Monday YYYY-MM-DD (America/Bogota); location column shows friendly names only (no raw `location_id` as primary label)
- Still fetches `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance` under the hood

Prefect / test vocabulary: `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` Phase 4 `name=` contract already matches `data/pipelines/pipeline.py` and `tests/pipelines/test_name_contract.py` (`brasaland_weekly_performance_pipeline`, `extract_brasaland_data_flow`, `transform_brasaland_kpis_flow`, `load_brasaland_reporting_flow`, `eval_brasaland_snapshot_flow`, domain tasks). No renames required; no generic `extract_data` / `business_metrics` left.

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/pipelines/ -q → 41 passed
cd uis/backoffice && npm run build → tsc -b && vite build green
Manual UI (CDP): login → Monday weekly report; audit forbidden jargon hits=[]; required KPI labels present; friendly location names; COP+USD; period America/Bogota
Artifacts: stakeholder_ux_03_monday_report.png, stakeholder_ux_04_kpi_table.png, stakeholder_ux_monday_report_walkthrough.mp4
```

## Latest milestone 9 — n8n Monday leadership report (`cursor/n8n-monday-leadership-report-3cb7`)

Department served: **Executive** (Mariana Restrepo — automated weekly report Monday 07:00) with **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero) and **Procurement** (Lucía Fernández) figures on the same report (purchase, waste, stockouts, price alerts, COP and USD kept separate).

Importable workflow `workflows/brasaland-monday-leadership-report.n8n.json` (inactive until credentials exist):

- Schedule cron `0 7 * * 1` with workflow timezone `America/Bogota` (not America/New_York: Bogotá has no daylight saving, and the chain week in `previous_chain_week_bounds` is America/Bogota). Manual trigger for a grader test.
- `POST /auth/login` using `BRASALAND_STAFF_EMAIL` / `BRASALAND_STAFF_PASSWORD`, then `GET /reporting/weekly-location-performance?week_start=` with Bearer JWT.
- Leadership text plus CSV under `/home/node/brasaland-reports` (host `workflows/out/`). Email (SMTP credential placeholder, CSV attached) and Slack (API credential placeholder) run when their env vars are set.
- Error output from login, missing token, KPI query, format, CSV write, email, and Slack writes `brasaland-weekly-failure.txt` and notifies when delivery env vars are set.
- Local n8n: `workflows/docker-compose.n8n.yml` (`n8nio/n8n:1.123.81`). Root `docker-compose.yml` was not changed.
- No live secrets in the export. Docker was not available in this run, so n8n itself was not started; the export was checked with the structure script and Node execution of the embedded week and report functions.

```text

```

## Latest Next.js portal (`cursor/nextjs-brasaland-portal-9a60`)

Department served: **Marketing** (Camila Ospina — digital Brasa Points) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — sales per location in COP and USD) + **Executive** (Mariana Restrepo — chain totals in both currencies). The portal calls Technology’s customers and sales nouns when `BRASALAND_DATA_SOURCE=live`. Before this merge those routers were **missing** on the branch, so the default is a typed fixture client. This does not complete a live POS or a digital wallet.

- App: `uis/portal` (Next.js App Router, TypeScript). Routes `/`, `/points`, `/points/[customerId]`, `/ops/sales`.
- Client: `GET /customers`, `GET /customers/{id}`, `GET /sales` (`location_id` + `currency`). Fallback when the live call fails. Staff JWT via `BRASALAND_API_TOKEN` (not committed).
- Points math from `docs/company-knowledge-base/brasaland-loyalty-program.en.md` (10,000 COP or 10 USD = 1 point; Bronze/Silver/Gold; redeem from 15 in steps of 5).
- Brand tokens match `uis/website` (charcoal, ember, Outfit, Source Sans 3).

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
Live mode matches draft central API shapes on `cursor/central-api-nouns-5989` (PR #89): `brasa_points_balance` + `loyalty_tier` + `order_history` without spend; `GET /sales` tickets (`amount`, `currency`, `location_id`, `occurred_at`) rolled up per location. `GET /sales/overview` location rows still accepted.
cd uis/portal && npm test → 16 passed (loyalty, COP/USD conversion, ticket rollup, stamp-card balance, env switch, fixture fallback)
cd uis/portal && npm run build → Next.js 15.5.26 compiled; routes / , /points , /points/[customerId] , /ops/sales
npm start → :3000
Browser: unknown email → not-found alert; ana.morales@guest.brasaland.example → balance 23, Silver, history, rewards
/ops/sales → chain COP $476,340,000 and chain USD $119,085.00; Florida filter → 6 Florida rows, Colombia hidden
Narrow viewport still shows the sales heading; console clear
```

Technology central API remains **incomplete** while menus/sales/customers/suppliers are `missing` on `services/api/app.py`. That sentence describes the portal run before the merge. After `origin/main` (`7b0a125`) those nouns, `POST /knowledge/query`, and `GET /realtime/ops-alerts/stream` are mounted with the portal.

## Latest central API nouns (`cursor/central-api-nouns-5989`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás Park — locations, menus, sales, customers, suppliers on one server) + **Operations** (Felipe — per-location COP/USD tickets and a no-sales alert list) + **Procurement** (Lucía — ~20 suppliers and price history) + **Marketing** (Camila — CRM with a Brasa Points stamp-card balance) + **Executive** (Mariana — chain totals in COP and USD) + **Training** (Jake — same menu in all 14 kitchens).

Built on `main` (`a7c9bf9`), not draft PR #64. Routers: `services/api/menus.py`, `sales.py`, `customers.py`, `suppliers.py`. `app.py` only mounts them; reporting stays mounted. Seeded snapshot, not a live POS. Brasa Points stay physical stamp cards (`digital_loyalty=false`).

```text
head -n 5 CONTEXT.md → # Welcome to Brasaland
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs → 200

GET /menus/catalogue → 6 items, currencies COP+USD, location_count 14
GET /sales/overview without token → 401
GET /sales/overview with Bearer → 14 locations, 42 tickets, chain_total_cop=476340000, chain_total_usd=119085, florida_total_usd=53460
GET /customers/cus-001 → Brasa Points, brasa_points_balance=32, loyalty_tier=silver, digital_loyalty=false
GET /suppliers/overview → total_suppliers=20, colombia_count=10, florida_count=10, price_alerts=8
```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 and 6). Criterion 5: locations, menus, sales, customers, and suppliers are **present**. That does not make POS integration, telemetry, or a digital loyalty wallet complete.

## Latest knowledge RAG (`cursor/knowledge-rag-query-34a7`)

Department served: **Training** (Jake Morrison — searchable standards) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — one route on the central API) + **Executive** (Mariana can ask a standards question; this is not the chain-sales assistant).

Kept `data/process/rag.py` + `data/pipelines/rag.py` (collection `brasaland_kb`, allergen and COP/USD rules). Retired `scripts/rag.py` (it searched `company_knowledge_base`) by making it delegate here. `services/api/main.py` no longer imports a missing router; it starts the same central app. `POST /knowledge/query` is `services/knowledge/routes.py`, included from `services/api/app.py`.

Default path needs no API key: local hashed embeddings and an extractive answer with cited chunks. `BRASALAND_RAG_BACKEND=qdrant` and `BRASALAND_RAG_LLM=openai` enable the vector store and chat model. Loyalty copy now matches `CONTEXT.md` (physical stamp cards; digital app not available yet).

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 + 6). At the time of that run, Technology’s menus/sales/customers/suppliers were still `missing`. Those nouns are mounted together with `/knowledge/query` after the merge from `origin/main` (`#89`).

## Latest merge of #89 into knowledge query (`cursor/knowledge-rag-query-34a7`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás Park — menus, sales, customers, suppliers, and `POST /knowledge/query` on one server) + **Training** (Jake Morrison — searchable standards stay mounted).

Merged `origin/main` (`5751231`, PR #89) into this branch. `services/api/app.py` includes `menus`, `sales`, `customers`, `suppliers`, and `services.knowledge.routes`. Both Progress entries above are kept.

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 and 6). Criterion 5: locations, menus, sales, customers, and suppliers are **present**, and `/knowledge/query` is present. That does not make POS integration, telemetry, or a digital loyalty wallet complete.

## Latest live no-sales alert (`cursor/realtime-no-sales-alert-198b`)

Department served: **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — alert when a location has no sales during opening hours) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — real-time telemetry on the central API).

SSE on `GET /realtime/ops-alerts/stream` (Bearer JWT, `fetch` + `ReadableStream`). Detection lives in `services/api/no_sales.py`; the router is `services/api/no_sales_router.py`. Sales enter through `sales_events.record_sale` so a future `/sales` router can hook in without this channel owning that noun. OpenAPI paths do not contain `sales`, so the coverage script still reports `sales=missing`.

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 + 6). At the time of that run, Technology’s menus/sales/customers/suppliers were still `missing`. Those nouns, `POST /knowledge/query`, and the realtime router are mounted together after the merge from `origin/main` (`0813179`).

Draft PRs **#53** (SSE tickets) and **#54** (WebSocket knowledge chat) can be closed. This branch reuses the SSE shape (named events, JWT via fetch, Last-Event-ID, reconnect backoff) on current `main` for the no-sales alert. Those drafts target other features and have diverged from `main`.

## Latest merge of main into the no-sales alert (`cursor/realtime-no-sales-alert-198b`)

Department served: **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — live no-sales alert stays mounted) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — locations, menus, sales, customers, suppliers, inventory, users, reporting, knowledge, and realtime on one server).

Merged `origin/main` (`0813179`, PR #93) into this branch. `services/api/app.py` includes the #89 routers, `services.knowledge.routes`, and `register_ops_alerts`. `locations.py` keeps `location_roster`, `all_locations`, and `get_location`. Progress keeps the central-API, knowledge, and no-sales entries.

## Latest merge of main into the Next.js portal (`cursor/nextjs-brasaland-portal`)

Department served: **Marketing** (Camila Ospina — `/points` stays) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — `/ops/sales` stays beside the live no-sales alert) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — seeded nouns, knowledge query, and realtime stream stay mounted).

Merged `origin/main` (`7b0a125`) into this branch. The only content conflict was `memory-bank/Progress.md`. Root package files, `.gitignore`, and CI did not overlap. `uis/README.md` keeps website, backoffice (including the no-sales alert), portal, and `web/`.

## Latest merge of main into the Monday leadership workflow (`cursor/n8n-monday-leadership-report`)

Department served: **Executive** (Mariana Restrepo — Monday 07:00 America/Bogota report stays) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — the workflow still reads the central reporting API that is mounted with the other routers).

Merged `origin/main` (`940987f`) into this branch. The only content conflict was `memory-bank/Progress.md`. Docs indexes for the central API, knowledge query, and no-sales alert stay, and `workflows/README.md` keeps the Monday report. The n8n export was not rewritten.

## Latest sales feed into the no-sales alert (`cursor/sales-feed-no-sales-alert-d91e`)

Department served: **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — a real ticket clears a quiet location) + **Technology** (Nicolás Park — `POST /sales` on the central API calls `record_sale`).

`GET /sales` was read-only. `POST /sales` appends the ticket to the same in-memory list and calls `record_sale` in `services/api/sales_events.py`. Unknown locations are 404. A currency that is not the location's COP or USD is 400.

```

## Latest telemetry event capture (`cursor/telemetry-event-capture-02f6`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás Park — real-time telemetry on the central API) + **Restaurant Operations** (Felipe Guerrero — kitchen stock corrections on the existing inventory panel).

`POST /telemetry/events` is mounted from `services/api/routers/telemetry.py` on `uvicorn api.app:app`. It checks the Phase 1 envelope (`eventID`, `Event_type`, `SchemaVersion` 1, `source`, `tags`) and logs the count plus each `Event_type`. It does not persist. The backoffice `TelemetryService` is the only telemetry sender: queue of 20 or 10 seconds, three retries, `sendBeacon` on hide. Staff session id is minted at login. Sixteen mandatory events fire from real writes: kitchen stock, a sale ticket (`dine_in` stays the default stored channel and maps to `in_store` on `sale_completed`), an inbound supplier line, a customer preference, a menu suggestion, people facts, and recipe publish/ack. `location_sales_silence_detected` stays with the silence monitor (live window is 30 minutes; the schema const is 45). `weekly_report_dispatched` stays with the Monday email send; opening the report is not that send.

```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 and 6). Criterion 5: locations, menus, sales, customers, and suppliers are **present**, and `POST /telemetry/events` is present. The stub does not store events. That does not make POS integration or a digital loyalty wallet complete.

## Latest telemetry event storage (`cursor/telemetry-event-storage-46d7`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás Park — real-time telemetry persisted on the central API). Stored `tags` keep Operations dimensions (`location_id`, `country`, `currency`) for the 14 locations.

`POST /telemetry/events` still accepts `{ "events": [...] }` as raw items. Each item is checked with `TelemetryEvent.model_validate`. Valid rows go to `public.telemetry_events` in one PostgREST insert. The response is `{received, stored, rejected}`. A batch with no valid events does not insert. A missing `SUPABASE_URL` or `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` returns 503 at request time. `TelemetryEvent` and `uis/` are unchanged. Mapping is in `docs/telemetry/telemetry-plan.md`. Migration: `supabase/migrations/20261006000000_telemetry_events.sql`.

```

Skill **passed** (criteria 1–4 and 6). Criterion 5: locations, menus, sales, customers, and suppliers are **present**, and `POST /telemetry/events` stores valid events. The live Supabase project was not queried in this run (service-role credentials were not available). That does not make POS integration or a digital loyalty wallet complete.

## Live Supabase verification of telemetry storage (`787c7cd`, then `search_path`)

Department served: **Technology** (Nicolás Park — the collector rows are in the live `public.telemetry_events` table).

A separate run, with no code changes at `787c7cd`, loaded the real backoffice in headless Chromium and posted `services/api/scripts/send_mixed_batch.sh`. There is no seed login; the run registered a local demo staff user with `POST /auth/register`. The table held 61 rows: 58 from the browser and 3 from the mixed batch. Mixed batch response: `{"received":4,"stored":3,"rejected":1}`. Business rows include `inbound_order_created` ×2, `sale_completed` ×2, `ingredient_price_variance_detected` ×2, and `stock_count_adjusted` ×1 (the −2 kitchen correction). There is no outbound order endpoint or form, so there is no `outbound_order_created` row. Location tags on the Medellín Centro sales and inbound lines are `co-med-centro`, Colombia, COP, `America/Bogota`. PATCH and DELETE through PostgREST both returned HTTP 400 `P0001` `telemetry_events is append-only`. The live function sets `search_path` to empty; the committed migration now does the same. Evidence images are under `docs/screenshots/`. `rows.json` was checked (no keys, no email addresses) and was not committed.

```text
mixed batch → {"received":4,"stored":3,"rejected":1}
live rows → 61 (58 browser + 3 script)

## How to update this file

After a verified change, append evidence (command + result) and update the coverage table. Do not log plans that were not run.
